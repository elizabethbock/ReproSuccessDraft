# Analysis Code

This is where you'll store the code for your analysis, typically a series of numbered and labelled R scripts, or other scripts in other languages, e.g. markdown files. This should read in the data directly from your *DryadData* folder and output all the files in your *TablesandFigures* folder. 

These are the scripts you will include with your paper submission, so they should be carefully commented with instructions. 

These will typically be made public upon submission/publication.
