## Raw Data

This is where you'll store your raw data files. These should typically be files pulled directly from the database or Box, or sent to you by a collaborator. For database downloads, you can rename the file with the table name and download date, but make no other modifications to the file.

Note that if you open the file in Excel and save it, even if you make no changes, some fields like dates will be reformatted to Excel's default date format.

If you need to make changes to the raw data, you should either make the change in the database and re-download the file, or make the change programatically in *DataCurationCode*.

These files will typically *not* be made public upon submission/publication.
