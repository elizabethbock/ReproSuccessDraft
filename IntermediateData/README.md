# Intermediate Data

This is where intermediate products of your analysis can be stored, that is anything you want to save in-between the *DryadData* and *TablesandFigures*. These may be outputs of summary statistics, the data directly underlying Figures or models, and/or outputs of code that are non-trivial to recreate because of long run-times, etc. 

These will typically be made public upon submission/publication.
